			    <h2>Khamaj raag</h2>
				</div>
		    
	       
			<p>Khamaj (IAST: Khamāj) is a Hindustani classical raga within the Khamaj thaat which is named after it.

Many ghazals and thumris are based on Khamaj. It utilises the shuddha (pure) form of Ni on the ascent, and the komala (flat) form of Ni on the descent, creating a key asymmetry in compositional and improvisational performance. This raga has been explored more in the lighter forms of Hindustani Classical Music such as Thumri, Tappa etc. Yet a few compositions in Dhrupad and Khayal are found as well.

			    <h2>Asawari Raag</h2>
		    </div>
			<p>Asavari (IAST: Āsāvari) is a Hindustani classical raga. It belongs to the Asavari thaat and is performed in the morning hours.

In pre-Bhatkhande days this Asavari used the Komal Rishab instead of Shuddh Rishab . When Bhatkhandeji created the thaat process, He changed that Asavari's Komal Rishab to Shuddha Rishab but the name remained the same. From that time the old or real 'Asavari' has been called the Komal Rishabh Asavari, and the new Shuddha Rishabh Asavari is simply called 'Asavari'.

			    <h2>Kalyan</h2>
		    </div>
			<p>Yaman (also known as Imaan,'Emann', 'Kalyani' in Carnatic classical music) is a heptatonic (Sampurna) Indian classical raga of Kalyan Thaat.
			Description
Yaman emerged from the parent musical scale of Kalyan. Considered to be one of the most fundamental ragas in Hindustani tradition, it is thus often one of the first ragas taught to students.


<br>Vadi and Samavadi
Vadi is ga, Samvadi is ni.
<br>
Pakad or Chalan<br>
Kalyan has no specific phrases or particular features, many musicians avoid Sa and Pa in ascend or treat them very weakly. You often hear N0 R G M+ D N S' in ascent and S' N D M+ G R S in descend[1]). 
Sa is avoided in beginning the ascend such as N0 R G M+ P D N S'
<br>

Kalyan is mixed with several ragas:
<br>
Puriya Kalyan,Yamani Bilawal,Hem Kalyan ,Gorakh Kalyan,Hindol Kalyan,Maru Kalyan,Ram Kalyan,Poorva Kalyan.
<br>Thaat: Kalyan is type raga of Kalyan thaat. In thaat Kalyan, all notes are shuddha (natural) except teevra (sharp) Ma.
<br>
Behavior
Yaman is regarded one of the grandest and most fundamental ragas in Hindustani music. It is one of the first ragas taught to students but it also has great scope for improvisation.
<br>
Samay (Time)
Ragas in the Kalyan thaat, including Yaman, should be performed during the first quarter of the night.
<br>
Rasa
<br>
Kalyan is described by Meshakarna(1570) as "lord in white garments and pearl necklace on a splendid lion-throne, under a royal umbrella, fanned with whisk, chewing betel"[2]

			    <h2>Todi Raag</h2>
		    </div>
			<p>iyan ki Todi, often simply referred to as Todi (IAST: Tōḍi), is a Hindustani classical raga which gave its name to the Todi thaat, one of the ten types of classical music according to the musicologist Bhatkhande. Ragas from the Todi raganga (class of ragas) include Todi (a.k.a. Miyan ki Todi) itself, Bilaskhani Todi, Gujari Todi (also called Gurjari Todi), Desi Todi, Hussaini Todi, Asavari Todi (more commonly known as Komal Rishabh Asavari), and Bahaduri Todi.

The equivalent raga in Carnatic music is Shubhapantuvarali. But in Todi, the pancham is omitted in the Arohana, But Shubhapanthuvarali uses the panchamam in both the arohana and avarohana. The Carnatic Melakarta Hanumatodi is the equivalent of Bhairavi thaat, but the Hindustani Bhairavi raga is the equivalent of Carnatic Sindhu Bhairavi. Carnatic Todi does not have any similarity with Hindustani Todi (Miyan ki Todi) raga. Though the Swarasthana orders of Carnatic Thodi are similar to Hindustani Bhairavi thaat, but when the Carnatic Todi is sung it has no similarity with Hindustani Todi, Bhairavi, or Carnatic Sindhu Bhairavi.

Vadi and Samavadi
<br>
Komal Dha and Komal Ga. 
Re, ga and dha are intoned slightly low, and tivra ma is very sharp.[2]

<br>Pakad or Chalan
The distinctive phrase is r/g-\r\S, where r may be subtly oscillated.[3] 
Pa is omitted in ascent, but present and often sustained.[4] Kaufmann mentions that some musicians would call Todi with Pa Miyan Ki Todi, but others would see no difference between Todi and Miyan Ki Todi. 
Sometimes the ascent is performed without Sa, starting from Ni.
<br>
Organization and relationships
Miyan Ki Todi is similar to Gujari Todi and many movements are common, but in Gujari Todi Pa is omitted and there is more emphasis on Re and Dha. 
Like Miyan Ki Malhar Miyan Ki Todi is said to be composed by Tansen, but this seems unlikely as the Todi scale in Tansen's time was the scale of today's Bhairavi and the name Miyan Ki Todi appears first in the 19th century literature.[5]
<br>
Samay (time)
Todi should be performed in the late morning.[6]
<br>
Rasa
Todi is nearly always shown as a gentle, beautiful woman, holding a veena and standing in a lovely green forest, surrounded by deer. Kaufman cites the Sangita-Darpana "With a fair erect body like the white lotus, and delicate like the gleaming dew drop, Todi holds the vina and provides fun and frolic to the deer deep in the forest. Her body is anointed with saffron and camphor".
<br>
Rasa in Indian classical music is understood as mood of the raga.</p>
