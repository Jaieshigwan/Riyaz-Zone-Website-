			<h1>Websofttutorials &#8211; India&#8217;s Hindi online tutors</h1>
<p>“Websofttutorials.com” is presently one of the top websites to explore and learn through totally free video tutorials over the internet. It all started on a bright day when “websofttutorials.com” was founded by me “Rishab Kapoor” back in the year 2012. The good thing about our website and the tutorials is the wide variety and topics of video tutorials I chose to teach on. Not only the video tutorials but interviewing questions are also present. All the video tutorials are found in three most common languages spoken in the world:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li>English</span></li>
<li>Hindi</span></li>
<li> Urdu</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I chose these three languages so that anyone can easily understand each tutorial we post on our website and on YouTube. Currently, our website Websofttutorials.com has a limited number of video tutorials on a limited number of courses or topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>BOOTSTRAP</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully soon, in the near future, we would add more video tutorials on courses like <strong>Mathematics, Physics and on topics like Photoshop, CorelDraw, C language and C++.</strong>  All of these topics and courses will be uploaded on our website soon, so keep checking the website. Plus, the upcoming video tutorials will be available in both English and Hindi languages. Currently, websofttutorials.com has over 32,000 YouTube subscribers and these numbers are increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Another good thing about my video tutorials is that it is constructed, taught and explained in such a way that even an expert or beginner of that particular topic will easily understand it. In the upcoming days, I will be uploading the video tutorials related to website designing, website development as well as software development. Don’t miss on these. I choose all those topics and courses to make video tutorials that will help each one of my follower to excel in it in the future.</p>
<p>Please do check my videos on YouTube as well. Don’t forget to subscribe our YouTube channel.  If you have any ideas and recommendations regarding my web site or regarding my tutorials, please feel free to email me at websofttutorials@gmail.com</p>
